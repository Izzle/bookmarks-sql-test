# Assignment
Revisit the Bookmarks application that you started working on in a previous lesson. Design a table to store the bookmarks. For each attribute of a bookmark that you can think of, identify the data type, size, whether it can be null, if its a primary key and if a default value makes sense.

Write an SQL script to automate the creation of the bookmarks table in the database and seeds the table with some data. Insert at least ten rows of data in the table.
